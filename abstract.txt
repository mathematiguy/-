ABSTRACT

When studying population change, it is crucial to understand various factors of depopulation. The aim of this study is to examine the changing population of small to medium sized cities due to planned cities under government-led projects and to present policy alternatives. Gongju City  was set as a study area since it experiences the most severe depopulation among the surrounding cities near Sejong Special Autonomous City. In addition, it conducted a comparative analysis by dividing each of the seven local governments into both content range (Yeosu City, Jeongeup City, and Haenam County) and spatial range (Gongju City, Hongseong County, Buyeo County, Yesan County, and Mungyeong City). Three local governments sorted as the content range have continuously experienced depopulation due to factors such as low birth rate or an aging population. There were three common factors to explain the depopulation in local governments belonging to content range. The primary factor for depopulation has been a lack of employment. Since the conglomerates and public enterprises which young people want to work for are mostly located in Seoul or other metropolitan areas, the population ratios in small to medium sized cities have aged and the number of young people is continuing to decrease. The secondary factor for depopulation has been the quality of available education. Education systems in small to medium sized cities is inferior to local metropolitan cities so people move to larger cities in order to access better education services which has worsened depopulation.Thirdly, insufficient public facilities have led to further depopulation. Since the local governments could not fully provide the necessary facilities, residents who felt uncomfortable with this have moved to other areas causing further depopulation. Regarding the spatial range, this study categorized societies, institutions, and policies largely into four factors about five local governments including the study area, Gongju City, and presented policy alternatives on populations of Gongju City.
Firstly, this study compared baby bonus policies. It was found that Mungyeong City supported a larger amount of baby bonus than other local governments. In the case of Gongju City, it supported a similar level of baby bonus to other local governments except Mungyeong City.
This study also compared child care benefit policies. It was shown that each local government offers various child care support policies. In the case of Gongju City, it did not support practical items but only single use items.
Relocation subsidies were also compared in this study. Similar to child care benefits, it was shown that each local government supports various policies on relocation subsidies. It was concluded that Mungyong City had the most outstanding relocation subsidies among those cities. On the other hand, the relocation subsidies of Gongju City was considered the poorest compared to other local governments.
Lastly, this study compared agro migration subsidies. In case of agro migration subsidies, there was little significant difference between local governments. Mungyeong City supported the necessary curriculum for agro migration. In the case of Gongju City, it had similar policies to Hongseong County. However, Gongju City did not support the curriculum which Mungyeong City does.
As a result of categorizing societies, institutions, and policies largely into four factors about five local governments including the study area, Mungyeong City executed outstanding policies among local governments but the policies of the others were at a similar level.
In conclusion, in previous studies, the aims were mainly to focus on analyzing the characteristics of overall changes in depopulation and demographic structures, and to analyze problems and solutions according to depopulation types. However, this study investigated how special laws promulgated by the government could affect surrounding citiesâ€™ population, and analyzed the causes of depopulation of surrounding cities affected by government policy and suggested solutions. In that regard, there was a difference between previous studies and this study.
Keywords: Formation of government-led planned cities, depopulation, population changes in the surrounding cities, population policies by local governments
